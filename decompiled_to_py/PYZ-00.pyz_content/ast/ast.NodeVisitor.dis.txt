## co_consts:
('NodeVisitor', "\n    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a\n    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value\n    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.\n\n    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor\n    methods.\n\n    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +\n    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would\n    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding\n    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node\n    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.\n\n    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during\n    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that\n    allows modifications.\n    ", <code object visit at 0x000002406941A8B0, file "ast.py", line 414>, <code object generic_visit at 0x00000240691DB120, file "ast.py", line 420>, <code object visit_Constant at 0x0000024068E91D70, file "ast.py", line 430>, None)
