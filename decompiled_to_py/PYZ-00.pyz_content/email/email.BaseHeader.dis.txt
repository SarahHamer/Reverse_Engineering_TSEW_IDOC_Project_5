('BaseHeader', "Base class for message headers.\n\n    Implements generic behavior and provides tools for subclasses.\n\n    A subclass must define a classmethod named 'parse' that takes an unfolded\n    value string and a dictionary as its arguments.  The dictionary will\n    contain one key, 'defects', initialized to an empty list.  After the call\n    the dictionary must contain two additional keys: parse_tree, set to the\n    parse tree obtained from parsing the header, and 'decoded', set to the\n    string value of the idealized representation of the data from the value.\n    (That is, encoded words are decoded, and values that have canonical\n    representations are so represented.)\n\n    The defects key is intended to collect parsing defects, which the message\n    parser will subsequently dispose of as appropriate.  The parser should not,\n    insofar as practical, raise any errors.  Defects should be added to the\n    list instead.  The standard header parsers register defects for RFC\n    compliance issues, for obsolete RFC syntax, and for unrecoverable parsing\n    errors.\n\n    The parse method may add additional keys to the dictionary.  In this case\n    the subclass must define an 'init' method, which will be passed the\n    dictionary as its keyword arguments.  The method should use (usually by\n    setting them as the value of similarly named attributes) and remove all the\n    extra keys added by its parse method, and then use super to call its parent\n    class with the remaining arguments and keywords.\n\n    The subclass should also make sure that a 'max_count' attribute is defined\n    that is either None or 1.
