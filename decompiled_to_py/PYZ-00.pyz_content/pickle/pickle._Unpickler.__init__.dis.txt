("This takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.\n\n        The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so\n        no proto argument is needed.\n\n        The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that\n        takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires\n        no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file*\n        can be a binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO\n        object, or any other custom object that meets this interface.\n\n        The file-like object must have two methods, a read() method\n        that takes an integer argument, and a readline() method that\n        requires no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.\n        Thus file-like object can be a binary file object opened for\n        reading, a BytesIO object, or any other custom object that\n        meets this interface.\n\n        If *buffers* is not None, it should be an iterable of buffer-enabled\n        objects that is consumed each time the pickle stream references\n        an out-of-band buffer view.  Such buffers have been given in order\n        to the *buffer_callback* of a Pickler object.\n\n        If *buffers* is None (the default), then the buffers are taken\n        from the pickle stream, assuming they are serialized there.\n        It is an error for *buffers* to be None if the pickle stream\n        was produced with a non-None *buffer_callback*.\n\n        Other optional arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and\n        *errors*, which are used to control compatibility support for\n        pickle stream generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True,\n        pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names\n        used in Python 3.  The *encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how\n        to decode 8-bit string instances pickled by Python 2; these\n        default to 'ASCII' and 'strict', respectively. *encoding* can be\n        'bytes' to read these 8-bit string instances as bytes objects.\n        ", None, 0)
