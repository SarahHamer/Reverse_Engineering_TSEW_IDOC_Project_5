# Disassembly for email.EmailPolicy.fold
# From module file: email.policy

## co_consts:
("+\n        Header folding is controlled by the refold_source policy setting.  A\n        value is considered to be a 'source value' if and only if it does not\n        have a 'name' attribute (having a 'name' attribute means it is a header\n        object of some sort).  If a source value needs to be refolded according\n        to the policy, it is converted into a custom header object by passing\n        the name and the value with any linesep characters removed to the\n        header_factory method.  Folding of a custom header object is done by\n        calling its fold method with the current policy.\n\n        Source values are split into lines using splitlines.  If the value is\n        not to be refolded, the lines are rejoined using the linesep from the\n        policy and returned.  The exception is lines containing non-ascii\n        binary data.  In that case the value is refolded regardless of the\n        refold_source setting, which causes the binary data to be CTE encoded\n        using the unknown-8bit charset.\n\n        ", True, ('refold_binary',))
