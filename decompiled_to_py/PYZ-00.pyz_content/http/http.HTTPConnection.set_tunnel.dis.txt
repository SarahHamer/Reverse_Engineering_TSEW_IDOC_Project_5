## co_consts:
('Set up host and port for HTTP CONNECT tunnelling.\n\n        In a connection that uses HTTP CONNECT tunneling, the host passed to the\n        constructor is used as a proxy server that relays all communication to\n        the endpoint passed to `set_tunnel`. This done by sending an HTTP\n        CONNECT request to the proxy server when the connection is established.\n\n        This method must be called before the HTTP connection has been\n        established.\n\n        The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send\n        with the CONNECT request.\n        ', "Can't set up tunnel for established connection", None)
