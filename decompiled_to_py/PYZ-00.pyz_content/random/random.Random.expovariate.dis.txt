## co_consts:
('Exponential distribution.\n\n        lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be\n        nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is\n        a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to\n        positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative\n        infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.\n\n        ', 1.0)
