('Decorator to indicate final methods and final classes.\n\n    Use this decorator to indicate to type checkers that the decorated\n    method cannot be overridden, and decorated class cannot be subclassed.\n\n    For example::\n\n        class Base:\n            @final\n            def done(self) -> None:\n                ...\n        class Sub(Base):\n            def done(self) -> None:  # Error reported by type checker\n                ...\n\n        @final\n        class Leaf:\n            ...\n        class Other(Leaf):  # Error reported by type checker\n            ...\n\n    There is no runtime checking of these properties. The decorator\n    attempts to set the ``__final__`` attribute to ``True`` on the decorated\n    object to allow runtime introspection.\n    ', True)
