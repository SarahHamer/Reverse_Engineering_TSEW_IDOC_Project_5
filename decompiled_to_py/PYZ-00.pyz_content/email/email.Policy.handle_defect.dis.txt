## co_consts:
('Based on policy, either raise defect or call register_defect.\n\n            handle_defect(obj, defect)\n\n        defect should be a Defect subclass, but in any case must be an\n        Exception subclass.  obj is the object on which the defect should be\n        registered if it is not raised.  If the raise_on_defect is True, the\n        defect is raised as an error, otherwise the object and the defect are\n        passed to register_defect.\n\n        This method is intended to be called by parsers that discover defects.\n        The email package parsers always call it with Defect instances.\n\n        ', None)
