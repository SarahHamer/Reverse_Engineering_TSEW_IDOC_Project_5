# Disassembly for shutil.copytree
# From module file: shutil

## co_consts:
("Recursively copy a directory tree and return the destination directory.\n\n    If exception(s) occur, an Error is raised with a list of reasons.\n\n    If the optional symlinks flag is true, symbolic links in the\n    source tree result in symbolic links in the destination tree; if\n    it is false, the contents of the files pointed to by symbolic\n    links are copied. If the file pointed by the symlink doesn't\n    exist, an exception will be added in the list of errors raised in\n    an Error exception at the end of the copy process.\n\n    You can set the optional ignore_dangling_symlinks flag to true if you\n    want to silence this exception. Notice that this has no effect on\n    platforms that don't support os.symlink.\n\n    The optional ignore argument is a callable. If given, it\n    is called with the `src` parameter, which is the directory\n    being visited by copytree(), and `names` which is the list of\n    `src` contents, as returned by os.listdir():\n\n        callable(src, names) -> ignored_names\n\n    Since copytree() is called recursively, the callable will be\n    called once for each directory that is copied. It returns a\n    list of names relative to the `src` directory that should\n    not be copied.\n\n    The optional copy_function argument is a callable that will be used\n    to copy each file. It will be called with the source path and the\n    destination path as arguments. By default, copy2() is used, but any\n    function that supports the same signature (like copy()) can be used.\n\n    If dirs_exist_ok is false (the default) and `dst` already exists, a\n    `FileExistsError` is raised. If `dirs_exist_ok` is true, the copying\n    operation will continue if it encounters existing directories, and files\n    within the `dst` tree will be overwritten by corresponding files from the\n    `src` tree.\n    ", 'shutil.copytree', None, ('entries', 'src', 'dst', 'symlinks', 'ignore', 'copy_function', 'ignore_dangling_symlinks', 'dirs_exist_ok'))
