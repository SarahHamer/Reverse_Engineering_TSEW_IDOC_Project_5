As join() always returns None, you must call\n        is_alive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the\n        thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.\n\n        When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will\n        block until the thread terminates.\n\n        A thread can be join()ed many times.\n\n        join() raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to join the current\n        thread as that would cause a deadlock. It is also an error to join() a\n        thread before it has been started and attempts to do so raises the same\n        exception.\n\n        ', 'Thread.__init__() not called', 'cannot join thread before it is started', 'cannot join current thread', None, 0, ('timeout',))
