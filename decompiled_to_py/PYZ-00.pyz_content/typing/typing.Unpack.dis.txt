## co_consts:
("Type unpack operator.\n\n    The type unpack operator takes the child types from some container type,\n    such as `tuple[int, str]` or a `TypeVarTuple`, and 'pulls them out'.\n\n    For example::\n\n        # For some generic class `Foo`:\n        Foo[Unpack[tuple[int, str]]]  # Equivalent to Foo[int, str]\n\n        Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')\n        # Specifies that `Bar` is generic in an arbitrary number of types.\n        # (Think of `Ts` as a tuple of an arbitrary number of individual\n        #  `TypeVar`s, which the `Unpack` is 'pulling out' directly into the\n        #  `Generic[]`.)\n        class Bar(Generic[Unpack[Ts]]): ...\n        Bar[int]  # Valid\n        Bar[int, str]  # Also valid\n\n    From Python 3.11, this can also be done using the `*` operator::\n\n        Foo[*tuple[int, str]]\n        class Bar(Generic[*Ts]): ...\n\n    Note that there is only some runtime checking of this operator. Not\n    everything the runtime allows may be accepted by static type checkers.\n\n    For more information, see PEP 646.\n    ", ' accepts only single type.', ('origin', 'args'))
