("Parser of RFC 2822 and MIME email messages.\n\n        Creates an in-memory object tree representing the email message, which\n        can then be manipulated and turned over to a Generator to return the\n        textual representation of the message.\n\n        The string must be formatted as a block of RFC 2822 headers and header\n        continuation lines, optionally preceded by a `Unix-from' header.  The\n        header block is terminated either by the end of the string or by a\n        blank line.\n\n        _class is the class to instantiate for new message objects when they\n        must be created.  This class must have a constructor that can take\n        zero arguments.  Default is Message.Message.\n\n        The policy keyword specifies a policy object that controls a number of\n        aspects of the parser's operation.  The default policy maintains\n        backward compatibility.\n\n        ", None)
