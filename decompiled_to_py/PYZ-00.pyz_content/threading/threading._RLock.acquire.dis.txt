# Disassembly for threading._RLock.acquire
# From module file: threading

## co_consts:
('Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.\n\n        When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock,\n        increment the recursion level by one, and return immediately. Otherwise,\n        if another thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked. Once\n        the lock is unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set\n        the recursion level to one, and return. If more than one thread is\n        blocked waiting until the lock is unlocked, only one at a time will be\n        able to grab ownership of the lock. There is no return value in this\n        case.\n\n        When invoked with the blocking argument set to true, do the same thing\n        as when called without arguments, and return true.\n\n        When invoked with the blocking argument set to false, do not block. If a\n        call without an argument would block, return false immediately;\n        otherwise, do the same thing as when called without arguments, and\n        return true.\n\n        When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive\n        value, block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout\n        and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.  Return true if the lock has\n        been acquired, false if the timeout has elapsed.\n\n        ', 1)
