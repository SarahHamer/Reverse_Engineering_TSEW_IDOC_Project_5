# Disassembly for http.HTTPResponse.geturl
# From module file: http.client

## co_consts:
('Return the real URL of the page.\n\n        In some cases, the HTTP server redirects a client to another\n        URL. The urlopen() function handles this transparently, but in\n        some cases the caller needs to know which URL the client was\n        redirected to. The geturl() method can be used to get at this\n        redirected URL.\n\n        ',)
