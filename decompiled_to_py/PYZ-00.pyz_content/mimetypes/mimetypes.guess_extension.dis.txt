# Disassembly for mimetypes.guess_extension
# From module file: mimetypes

## co_consts:
("Guess the extension for a file based on its MIME type.\n\n    Return value is a string giving a filename extension, including the\n    leading dot ('.').  The extension is not guaranteed to have been\n    associated with any particular data stream, but would be mapped to the\n    MIME type `type' by guess_type().  If no extension can be guessed for\n    `type', None is returned.\n\n    Optional `strict' argument when false adds a bunch of commonly found,\n    but non-standard types.\n    ",)
