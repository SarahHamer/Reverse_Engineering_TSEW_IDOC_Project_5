("Returns an instance of the class mimetools.Message containing\n        meta-information associated with the URL.\n\n        When the method is HTTP, these headers are those returned by\n        the server at the head of the retrieved HTML page (including\n        Content-Length and Content-Type).\n\n        When the method is FTP, a Content-Length header will be\n        present if (as is now usual) the server passed back a file\n        length in response to the FTP retrieval request. A\n        Content-Type header will be present if the MIME type can be\n        guessed.\n\n        When the method is local-file, returned headers will include\n        a Date representing the file's last-modified time, a\n        Content-Length giving file size, and a Content-Type\n        containing a guess at the file's type. See also the\n        description of the mimetools module.\n\n        ",)
