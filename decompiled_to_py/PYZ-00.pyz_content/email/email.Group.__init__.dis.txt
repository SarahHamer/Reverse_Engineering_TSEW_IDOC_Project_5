## co_consts:
('Create an object representing an address group.\n\n        An address group consists of a display_name followed by colon and a\n        list of addresses (see Address) terminated by a semi-colon.  The Group\n        is created by specifying a display_name and a possibly empty list of\n        Address objects.  A Group can also be used to represent a single\n        address that is not in a group, which is convenient when manipulating\n        lists that are a combination of Groups and individual Addresses.  In\n        this case the display_name should be set to None.  In particular, the\n        string representation of a Group whose display_name is None is the same\n        as the Address object, if there is one and only one Address object in\n        the addresses list.\n\n        ', None)
