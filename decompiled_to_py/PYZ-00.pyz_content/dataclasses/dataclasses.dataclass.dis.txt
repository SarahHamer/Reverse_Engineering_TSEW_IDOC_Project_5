# Disassembly for dataclasses.dataclass
# From module file: dataclasses

## co_consts:
('Add dunder methods based on the fields defined in the class.\n\n    Examines PEP 526 __annotations__ to determine fields.\n\n    If init is true, an __init__() method is added to the class. If repr\n    is true, a __repr__() method is added. If order is true, rich\n    comparison dunder methods are added. If unsafe_hash is true, a\n    __hash__() method is added. If frozen is true, fields may not be\n    assigned to after instance creation. If match_args is true, the\n    __match_args__ tuple is added. If kw_only is true, then by default\n    all fields are keyword-only. If slots is true, a new class with a\n    __slots__ attribute is returned.\n    ', <code object wrap at 0x000002406945D890, file "dataclasses.py", line 1219>)
